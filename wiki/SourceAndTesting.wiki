#summary Source Usage and Testing Mechanisms for this system

* NOT YET AVAILABLE *

= Source Code Layout =

The layout of the system has been changed over into multiple Eclipse projects in order to reduce code duplication across the
Java library and the Android library. Additionally, there are 3 additional Eclipse projects that exist in order to help with
testing the source code: a Google App Engine/GWT project for hosting the test services and testing the services in GWT, a 
sample Android app for manual testing, and an Android testing app to conduct automated testing of the library on Android.
All Eclipse launchers are stored in the {{{.settings}}} folder of the respective projects. On project import, they should be
directly available to you, check the Run Configurations manually in case they don't show up right away.

For the time being, these descriptions only apply to the source within the AndroidDev branch (Will be available in the next few days).
Once field testing and documentation updating has completed, the trunk will be updated to reflect the same. The project's original
testing structure has been maintained for the time being, however it is not utilized in descriptions below as there were functional
problems in utilizing and verifying the tests in an automated manner. If a user would like to provide documentation on utilizing the
prior testing system, please let us know and we'll add it to the Wiki.

== Dependencies ==

All testing projects are setup to draw the testing services directly from GWT source so that it can be automatically tested
against the latest version as GWT changes. As such, you must have a checkout of the entire google-web-toolkit trunk checked out
to the path {{{google-web-toolkit}}} in your workspace. Additionally, you will need a gdata checked-out to {{{gdata}}} within
your workspace as well. The Android library is dependent on the included gwt-servlet.jar library. This was taken directly from
the {{{war/WEB-INF/lib}}} path of a generated GWT/GAE project. While only about of the sources in the gwt-user are needed for the
project, there is a lot of internal referencing that can cause errors if not made available. A future release (likely before the commit to trunk)
will utilize a smaller subset of these source files once they can be verifiably tested (in order to provide a smaller footprint for the library).
I've already had some success in reducing the servlet jar down to about 30 linked sources if I modified about 4 files to break the source
hierarchy, but it will take some more testing before I can reliable say that

Checking out the entire trunk with all necessary dependencies should give you a layout workspace similar to the following:

{{{
Workspace\
Workspace\gdata
Workspace\google-web-toolkit
Workspace\gwt-syncproxy
Workspace\SPAAppTest
Workspace\SPALibrary
Workspace\SPWebTest
}}}

All paths within the Eclipse projects are path dependent on the {{{WORKSPACE_LOC}}} variable, so make sure it is set properly to avoid
build path problems. The *google-web-toolkit* dependencies for are primarily for testing purposes as the general *gwt-syncproxy* library
will function with the _gwt-user.jar_ in place. However, the *gdata* dependencies are utilized directly in the library, so those will be needed
in production as well. After the dev branch has been made available, I will work on putting together a list of the testing sources linked
from *google-web-toolkit* for any developer who isn't going to be using the Eclipse environment.

=== GWT, GAE, and Android ===

The current library has been compiled against GWT 2.5.0, GAE 1.7.5, and Android V17. Testing against newer versions should be as simple
as updating the library references within each appropriate project and updating the checked-out source code for GWT and GData.

If you are utilizing the Android library, the account management system is only available on a Google APIS Android Virtual Device for testing.
It is recommended that you create and utilize an AVD with as much memory as your system will accept (Windows may max at about 768mb)
and a VM Heap of at least 64 to help with testing. Additionally, the Android library comes with the ability to send fake accounts while testing
against a local GAE dev server. Please see the AndroidLibrary wiki doc for details.

== Service Hosting ==

The *SPWebTest* project hosts an AppEngine project that serves several of the gwt-user test services for both the Java and Android client
to send tests to, generally testing serialization of different formats and types. In order to utilize the hosting server:

 # GWT-Compile the *SPWebTest* project
 # Launch the {{{SPAWebTest}}} launcher
 # Open the local URL to startup the module

== Java Library ==

In order to use the Java-only Library and testing, you need only get two projects from the source, *gwt-syncproxy* and *SPWebTest*.
There are two sets of tests contained between these two projects: one to test the hosted services (just to make sure nothing 
has changed), and one to test the library from a Java-stand alone. The gwt hosting tests can be run utilizing the {{{SPGWTTest-dev}}}
launcher and the Java stand alone tests can be launched using the {{{PojGSPTests}}} launcher.

== Android Library ==

The Android library requires all of the source hierarchy described above [SourceAndTesting#Dependencies]. Additionally, there is an
integrated project that will need to be imported into eclipse within the {{{SPAAppTest/tests/}}} path. This contains the source
for the *SPAAppTester* project, which conducts the Android JUnit testing using the *SPAAppTest* app as a base. The android tests
can be launched using the {{{SPATests}}} launcher. The actual app for manual testing can be launched using the {{{SPA_App}}} launcher.

= Testing =

This portion of the document will review the process needed to add more tests throughout the system. All testing within the system is 
currently done utilizing the JUnit structures, and there are 3 separate locations to add tests.

== Testing Against a Service ==

If your test will be run against a service, there are a number of steps to ensure success without compile/run-time issues.

 # Create the service in the *SPWebTest* project
 # Even if it is not utilized manually, make sure it is referenced in the {{{client/SPAWebTest}}} class so that it's service handle will be serialized for retrieval.
 # Add the servlet handlers to the {{{web.xml}}}
 # GWT-Compile the SPWebTest project
 # Create a test within the {{{test/.../client/gwttests}}} path. Be sure to properly utilize the GWTTestCase finishTest() and delayTestFinish() methods for Asynchronous testing.
 # Add this test to the {{{/gwttests/GwtTests}}} TestSuite class.
 
== Java Stand Alone Testing ==

 You can utilize the same testing structure for the stand along test, but you will need to modify the source-copied to work outside the GWTTestCase
structure.

 # Copy the test case into the *gwt-syncproxy* project {{{test/.../test/poj/}}} path.
 # Convert the test from a GWTTestCase to a TestCase
 # (Recommended not required) Create the SyncProxy service statically in the test case.
 # Convert the finishTest()/delayTestFinish() to utilize a CountDownLatch. This can be easily done across a large test case with the following search/replacements
 	* If you have a standard method start, like _service = GWT.create(...)_, Replace With _{{{final CountDownLatch signal = new CountDownLatch(1);}}}_
 	* Search _{{{finishTest()}}}_ Replace with _{{{signal.countDown()}}}_
 	* Search _{{{delayTestFinish(2000)}}}_ Replace with _{{{assertTrue("Failed to Complete", signal.await(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS))}}}_
 # Resolve any pending issues
 # Add this testcase to {{{PojGSPTests}}} TestSuite class
 
== Android AppTester Testing ==
 
 As with the Java Stand Alone Testing, you can utilize the converted Java SA test for the Android Testing system. This requires some additional
 subtle modification since Android requires network access to be completed off the main thread. We do this with the AsyncTask.
 
  # Copy the converted test case in the Java Stand Alone to the * SPAAppTester * {{{test/gwttests}}} path. 
  # Convert TestCase to {{{ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2<MainActivity>}}}
  # Connect to the service in the Constructor using the following pattern:
  	* Take note of the url path that is connected to. Android uses the 10.0.2.2 url to access the locally hosted webserver at 127.0.0.1.
  	{{{
  		final CountDownLatch signal = new CountDownLatch(1);
		final AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void> task = new AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void>() {
			@Override
			protected Void doInBackground(Void... arg0) {
				service = (CollectionsTestServiceAsync) SyncProxy
						.newProxyInstance(CollectionsTestServiceAsync.class,
								"http://10.0.2.2:8888/spawebtest/",
								"collections", true);
				signal.countDown();
				return null;
			}
		};
		task.execute();
		if (!signal.await(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
			throw new RuntimeException("Failed to get service started");
		}
 	}}}
 # Convert to the AsyncTask system utilizing the following Search/Replace systems as a guide. It will be very useful to utilize auto-format after these search/replacements
 	* Search _{{{service.echo}}}_ (or your appropriate method call) Replace with _{{{final AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void> myTask = new AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void>() {@Override	protected Void doInBackground(Void... arg0){ service.echo}}}_
 	* Search _{{{});}}}_ Replace with _{{{});return null;}};runTestOnUiThread(new Runnable(){@Override public void run(){myTask.execute();}});}}}_
 	* Search _{{{throws InterruptedException}}}_ Replace with _{{{throws Throwable}}}_
 	
= Current Testing Failures =
 
 Within the current set of tests implemented, there are a couple of tests which are failing, so please see below a for a list of failures and the issue.
 There are also a number of tests in the original test system which were not re-implemented (either for time or other reason, explained below).
 
|| TestCase || Project || Issue || Resolution/Reason ||
|| AsyncEnumsTest & EnumsTest || Java & Android || Failure on Server side because the Enums don't implement the IsSerializable interface || A manual override of those enum classes with the IsSerializable interface makes the tests pass. ||
|| HttpsTest || Java & Android || SSL Plain Text Error || None at this time ||
|| RecursiveClassTest || ALL || Not reimplemented || No original implementation ||
|| SessionTest || ALL || Not reimplemented || Non-Valuable Test for New Testing scenarios ||
|| XsrfProtectionTest || ALL || Not Fully Implemented || Many of the original tests were not implemented ||
